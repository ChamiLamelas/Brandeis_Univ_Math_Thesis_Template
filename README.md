# Brandeis University Math Senior Honors Thesis Template

*July 2022*

This repository holds a LaTeX file that serves as a template for senior honors theses in the Brandeis University Department of Mathematics. The department requires that the thesis follow a certain format as specified [here](https://www.brandeis.edu/mathematics/undergraduate/senior-honors-thesis.html). 

## Repository Contents

* `main.tex`: This is the LaTeX file which you can fill in for your own thesis.
* `refs.bib`: This is a LaTeX citation file. I found that finding a piece of work on Google Scholar then going to Cite > BibTeX was the most convenient way to find BibTeX citations. 
* `thesis_template.pdf`: This is a PDF file that holds the compiled output of `main.tex` using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).
* `ugthesis-signature.docx`: This is a Word file provided by the Brandeis Math department that specifies the layout of the signature page. The fourth page of `thesis_template.pdf` is based on this.
* `ugthesis-title.docx`: This is a Word file provided by the Brandeis Math department that specifies the layout of the title pages. The first three pages of `thesis_template.pdf` are based on this.

## Notes

* I used [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) to write these files and would recommend you do the same. You can get an Overleaf Professional account using your Brandeis email. In here you will find various templates such as the thesis template for the Computational Linguistics graduate program written by Professor [Constantine Lignos](https://lignos.org/).
